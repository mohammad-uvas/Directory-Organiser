# Directory Organiser

The code uses the NodeJS modules for getting a way of working with directories, file paths and allowing us to work with the file system of our computer and to make a command line interface to organise directories.

## Environment

    Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Modules Used

    Node.js Path Module
    Node.js File System Module

## Usage

Once you have installed Node.js open the Command Prompt on the Directory Organiser folder. 

run the node cli.js help to get the list of commands.

After knowing the commands you can run the command by writing 
node cli.js commandname directorypath
If directorypath is not given, then the current working directory is taken into consideration.
